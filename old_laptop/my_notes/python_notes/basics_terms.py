1. reserved words - are words which are by default in computer. we can't used them as variable names/identity.
2. variable - they are something which is not fix, not constant. name of variable Doesn't matter
  (example goOD, _gOO_D, GO234od            30bad, #bad, ba.d           Different, different, diffERent, differENT)
3. function - to perform any task we need function, they guild the python to do a task as the functions are reserved.
4. constant - something which don't change it's value, it's fix. they Become reserved words
5. operator - we can perform operations using operator (like =, +, *, **, ect)
6. expression - a sentence with operators
6. parameter - type of variable assign by user
7. syntax - basically the line
8. conditional - which has some condition, it can be function,syntax, ect.
9. input - the things given by user
10. output - the result we get from python
11. print - python can see and read our code but if we want to see that then we must use print.
12. indent - is the extra space after the function to tell these things are also a part of function
13. de-indent - get out of indent
14. string(str) - just a group of letters and numbers in [ "." OR '.' ]
15. integer(int) - all normal integers (like 2, 0, -2)
16. float(float) - int with decimal (like 2.0, 0.0, -2.0)
    we can inter convert int and float using build-in functions int(var) and float(var), usage - var_01 = int(var_02)
17. parenthesis() - bracket, all kind of brackets
18. comments(#) - python simply ignores it so write whatever u like ( # x = 5 is not considered by python)
19. argument - the input we put into the function in parenthesis. the thing in bracket in any functions.
20. return - very similar to print. It gives(return) the value we write their.
22. break - it ends the current loop and jumps out of it ( leave the loop and do things which immediately follow loop )  it's like get out NOW!!
23. continue - to continue it ( it goes up start again )
24. pass - it's a null operation(when it is executed, nothing happens) it's useful as a placeholder when a statement is required syntactically,but no code needs to be executed
    for example:- def fun(arg): pass  # a function that does nothing (yet)
24. for i (iterator) in X (iterable) -> here iterable = which can be loop through
25. iteration variables - which change each time as they go through the loop ( iteration- repetition of process )
26. import - some functions can't be use without importing them
27. input - we ask user to give some data [usage - ip = input(" >>>")] , it can't read further until data give(by user), it's always string
28. del - delete anything which we created , usage - del variable_01, variable_02 
29. abs - it's makes value to positive one, similar to |mod| in maths

# we don't directly write the code in python and end with error instead we write them in file and tell python to run it
# the code is like instruction manual where we go line by line, we can skip, repeat, remember it same goes with python

# ## Basic Maths ## #
a = -10
a = (a + 60)/5*10 - 11  # follow bodmas(== pemdas in computers and here p for parentheses which means brackets)
b = abs(a) = abs(-10) => abs makes negative value to positive, similar to |mod|

# addition(+), subtraction(-), multiplication(*), division(/), power(**), [reminder(%) - it can be int OR float], [floor(//) - (result is the quotient and not the reminder)]
# operations can be done b/w int and int OR str and str BUT not b/w int and str
# a lesser/smaller to b(a < b), greater(a > b), equal(a == b), lesser or equal(a <= b), greater or equal(a >= b), not equal(a != b) NOTE: (=<, => is not gonna work)
# comparison operators return true or false that it. they just compare .
# REMEMBER: "=" is use for assigning and "==" means equal to.( a = 1 and a == b is two different thing )
