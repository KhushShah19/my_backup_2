In the year 2041, my parents gambled and deposited all their life’s earning with a private company who was planning a mission to take humans to hospitable Mars by the year 2050. Overpopulation was the whole Earth’s problem, and several companies promised people to take them to Mars. Everyone was betting all of their savings on one of these enterprises. My parents did too.

Unfortunately, of some thirty odd companies who took the deposits, only one could successfully attempt a mission to Mars but could take only seven people at a time. All others got shut down. It had been nine years since we’ve lost all our money.
