    Concepts: 
    Abstract ideas or mental constructs that represent a particular class or category of things, events, or experiences. Concepts are often used to organize and categorize information and can be used to make sense of complex or unfamiliar information.  In the context of machine learning and data science, concepts may refer to the underlying principles or theories that are being studied or modeled.

    Dataset: 
    A collection of data that is organized and structured for a specific purpose, such as training a machine learning model or conducting statistical analysis. This can include both raw data, such as raw text or numerical values, and preprocessed data, such as cleaned and transformed data.

    Documents: 
    Files that contain text, images, or other types of media and are used for a variety of purposes, such as storing information or communicating ideas. Examples of documents include word processing documents, PDF files, and Markdown files.

    Models: 
    A mathematical representation of a system, process, or concept that is used to make predictions, understand relationships, or solve problems. In the context of machine learning, a model is an algorithm that is trained on a dataset and can make predictions or classifications based on new input data.

    Testing: 
    The process of evaluating the performance of a model or system by providing it with input data and comparing the output to expected results. Testing helps ensure that a model or system is functioning correctly and is able to make accurate predictions or perform its intended tasks.

    Utilities: 
    Small, specialized tools or functions that are designed to perform specific tasks or solve specific problems. These can be standalone programs or libraries that are used to perform tasks such as data manipulation, file management, or network communication.

    Features: The input variables or characteristics that are used to train a machine learning model. Features can be numeric or categorical and can be derived from raw data or preprocessed data.

    Labels: The output variables or target variables that are used to train a machine learning model. Labels are the values that the model is trying to predict or classify based on the input features.

    Training: The process of building a machine learning model by providing it with a dataset and optimizing the model's parameters based on the relationships between the input features and the labels.

    Validation: The process of evaluating a machine learning model's performance on a separate dataset that was not used for training. Validation helps assess the generalization ability of the model and can be used to tune its hyperparameters.

    Hyperparameters: The parameters of a machine learning model that are set by the practitioner and are not learned from data during training. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate and regularization coefficients in a neural network or the maximum depth of a decision tree.

    Overfitting: A phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is overly complex and has learned the noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. Overfitting can lead to poor generalization performance on new data.

    Underfitting: A phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Underfitting can lead to poor performance on both the training and validation data.
